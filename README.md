# Resources
If you've been asking yourself lately about how you could help in these trying times, this is a list of (growing) resources where you can give back. As this is public, I am accepting pull requests for suggestions.

Quick note: The majority of this content is pulled from and inspired by a collaboration between three small businesses in the Seattle area ([Sugar Pill](http://www.sugarpillseattle.com/), [Substantial](http://substantial.com/), and [Girlie Press](http://www.girliepress.com/)). Truly wonderful work! I hope - with the help of a community - to take it to the next level. Website coming soon.

###Love is a way to fight hatred.

###Action is a way to fight despair.
