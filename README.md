# Resources
If you've been asking yourself lately about how you could help in these trying times, this is a list of (growing) resources where you can give back. As this is public, I am accepting pull requests for suggestions.

Quick note: A lot of this content is pulled from and inspired by a collaboration between three local businesses ([Sugar Pill](http://www.sugarpillseattle.com/), [Substantial](http://substantial.com/), and [Girlie Press](http://www.girliepress.com/)) that call Seattle, WA home. Website coming soon.

>Love is a way to fight hatred.
>Action is a way to fight despair.
>Take good care of yourself.
>Take extra care of those around you.
